    <h2>What is Sanctum?</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is a small, reviewable, capable, PQ-secure and fully
        privilege separated novel VPN daemon and protocol designed to
        run under OpenBSD, Linux and MacOS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sanctum is designed from the ground up with security in mind and
        will always be open and free, licensed under the ISC license.
    </p>

    <p>
        Its unique privilege separation design in combination with
        strong modern sandboxing guarantee that all of its important assets
        are separated from processes that talk to the internet or handle
        non-cryptography related things.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sanctum allows you to create different topologies, from traditional
        site-to-site L2/L3 tunnels, to more niche topologies such as
        one-way tunnels, full-mesh L2/L3 and even P2P E2EE tunnels between
        devices behind NAT using hole-punching and Sanctum's cathedrals
        for peer discovery.
    </p>

    <p>
        Cathedral networks can be used to implement more secure replacements
        for things like Tailscale or Zerotier, where you are in control and
        where all traffic is properly cryptographically separated from each
        other.
    </p>

    <p>
        A community driven cathedral network exists allowing you to test
        different setups or even freely use it, see
        <a target="_blank" href="https://reliquary.se">The Reliquary</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi-process</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is built using a multi-process approach where each process
        is only doing one thing. This allows for more fine-grained sandboxing
        in relation to permissions or allowed system calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        Packets flow between these processes in a well-defined manner
        making it impossible to move a packet straight from the red
        side to the black side without passing the encryption process and
        vice-versa.
    </p>

    <h2>Encryption</h2>

    <p>
        See <a href="/crypto.html">the cryptography page</a> for
        a detailed description of the cryptosystem in sanctum.
