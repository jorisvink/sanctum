    <h2>What is sanctum?</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is a small, reviewable, capable, pq-safe and <strong>fully
        privilege seperated</strong> VPN daemon capable of transporting
        encrypted network traffic between two peers.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi-process</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is built using a multi-process approach where each process
        is only doing one thing. This allows for more fine-grained sandboxing
        in relation to permissions or allowed system calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several different processes exist that all only perform one task:
        <ul>
        <li>bless - The encryption process.</li>
        <li>confess - The decryption process.</li>
        <li>chapel - The key exchange process.</li>
        <li>heaven-rx - The red side receiving process.</li>
        <li>heaven-tx - The red side transmitting process.</li>
        <li>purgatory-rx - The black side receiving process.</li>
        <li>purgatory-tx - The black side transmitting process.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Packets flow between these processes in a well-defined manner
        making it impossible to move a packet straight from the red
        side to the black side without passing the encryption process and
        vice-versa.
    </li>

    <h2>Encryption</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is post-quantum safe due to its unique approach to
        deriving session keys based on a shared symmetrical secret in
        combination with a hybridized asymmetrical exchange. It combines
        both classic ECDH (x25519) and the PQ-safe NIST standardized
        ML-KEM-1024.
    </p>

    <p>
        Traffic is by default encrypted under AES256-GCM with unique keys in
        both RX and TX directions using a 96-bit nonce consisting of a 32-bit
        salt and a 64-bit packet counter (see rfc4106).
    </p>

    <p>
        For management traffic unique encryption keys are derived from the
        shared secret per message. In this case because the keys are freshly
        derived the nonces used in this construction are fixed as there is no
        risk for (key, nonce) pair re-use in this specific scenario.
    </p>

    <h2>Key exchange</h2>

    <p>
        Ssanctum uses a strong shared symmetrical secret in combination
        with two asymmetrical secrets (ECDH and ML-KEM-1024) to derive
        session keys for both RX and TX directions.
    </p>

    <p>
        The key exchange process looks as follows:
    </p>

<pre>
ss = shared symmetrical key, 256-bit, loaded from disk
offer_base = KMAC256(ss, "SANCTUM.KEY.OFFER.KDF"), 256-bit
traffic_base = KMAC256(ss, "SANCTUM.KEY.TRAFFIC.KDF"), 256-bit

derive_offer_encryption_key(seed):
    input = len(seed) || seed
    wk = KMAC256(offer_base, "SANCTUM.SACRAMENT.KDF", input), 256-bit
    return wk

offer_create():
    offer.ecdh = X25519-KEYGEN()
    offer.kem  = ML-KEM-1024-KEYGEN()
    offer.now  = TIME(WALL_CLOCK), 64-bit
    offer.id   = PRNG(64-bit), unique sanctum id
    offer.salt = PRNG(32-bit), salt for nonce construction
    offer.spi  = PRNG(32-bit), the spi for this association

    offer.internal_seed = unused and set to random data
    offer.internal_tag  = unused and set to random data

    return offer

offer_send_pk(offer):
    seed = PRNG(512-bit)
    dk = derive_offer_encryption_key(seed)

    header = 0x53414352414D4E54 || offer.spi || seed
    pt = id || salt || now || internal_seed ||
         offer.ecdh.pub || offer.kem.pk || internal_tag
    encdata = AES256-GCM(dk, nonce=1, aad=header, pt)

    packet.header = header
    packet.data = encdata
    send(packet)

offer_recv_pk(offer):
    packet = recv()

    dk = derive_offer_encryption_key(packet.header.seed)
    pt = AES256-GCM(dk, nonce=1, aad=packet.header, packet.data)

    ecdh_ss = X25519-SCALAR-MULT(pt.ecdh.pub, offer.ecdh.private)
    offer.kem.ct, kem_ss = ML-KEM-1024-ENCAP(pt.kem.pk)

    x = len(ecdh_ss) || ecdh_ss || len(kem_ss) || kem_ss ||
        len(ecdh.pub) || ecdh.pub || len(pt.ecdh.pub) || pt.ecdh.pub
    rx = KMAC256(traffic_base, "SANCTUM.TRAFFIC.KDF", x), 256-bit

    return rx

offer_send_ct(offer):
    seed = PRNG(512-bit)
    dk = derive_offer_encryption_key(seed)

    header = 0x53414352414D4E54 || spi || seed
    pt = id || salt || now || internal_seed ||
         offer.ecdh.pub || offer.kem.ct || internal_tag
    encdata = AES256-GCM(dk, nonce=1, aad=header, pt)

    packet.header = header
    packet.data = encdata
    send(packet)

offer_recv_ct(offer):
    packet = recv()

    dk = derive_offer_encryption_key(packet.header.seed)
    pt = AES256-GCM(dk, nonce=1, aad=packet.header, packet.data)

    ecdh_ss = X25519-SCALAR-MULT(pt.ecdh.pub, offer.ecdh.private)
    kem_ss = ML-KEM-1024-DECAP(offer.kem, pt.kem.ct)

    x = len(ecdh_ss) || ecdh_ss || len(kem_ss) || kem_ss ||
        len(ecdh.pub) || ecdh.pub || len(pt.ecdh.pub) || pt.ecdh.pub
    tx = KMAC256(traffic_base, "SANCTUM.TRAFFIC.KDF", x), 256-bit

    return tx

key exchange:
    my_offer = offer_create()
    peer_offer = offer_create()

    offer_send_pk(my_offer)
    tx = offer_recv_ct(my_offer)

    rx = offer_recv_pk(peer_offer)
    offer_send_ct(peer_offer)
</pre>

    <p>
        Keys are expired automatically after a given number of packets
        have been submitted on them (1 << 34), or after 1-hour.
    </p>

    <h2>Why did you write sanctum?</h2>

    <p>
        I wrote it so I can be certain that my packets are blessed
        correctly according to the scriptures of cryptology.
    </p>

    <h2>Huh?</h2>

    <p>
        Ok, I wrote sanctum because I wanted something I can trust
        fully myself. I am a very private person and want to
        excercise my right to privacy, even online.
        There are definitely alternatives, but I opted to
        carve out something for myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Plus, it's cool to hack on stuff.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes you qualified to build this?</h2>

    <p>
        If you are asking yourself that question, that's ok.
        The people who know, know. I have been building these
        type of things for many years at high assurance levels.
        Now, if this makes you nervous and rather not use Sanctum that is
        fine, there are
        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com" target="_blank">plenty</a>
        <a href="https://openvpn.net" target="_blank">of</a>
        <a href="https://strongswan.org" target="_blank">alternatives</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        But none of them have cool mythology though ;)
    </p>
