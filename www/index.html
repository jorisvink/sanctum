    <h2>What is Sanctum?</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is a small, reviewable, capable, PQ-secure and fully
        privilege separated novel VPN daemon and protocol designed to
        run under OpenBSD, Linux and MacOS.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sanctum is designed from the ground up with security in mind and
        will always be open and free, licensed under the ISC license.
    </p>

    <p>
        Its unique privilege separation design in combination with
        strong modern sandboxing guarantee that all of its important assets
        are separated from processes that talk to the internet or handle
        non-cryptography related things.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sanctum allows you to create different topologies, from traditional
        site-to-site L2/L3 tunnels, to more niche topologies such as
        one-way tunnels, full-mesh L2/L3 and even P2P tunnels between
        devices behind NAT using hole-punching and Sanctum's cathedrals
        for peer discovery.
    </p>

    <p>
        A community driven cathedral network exists allowing you to test
        different setups or even freely use it, see
        <a target="_blank" href="https://reliquary.se">The Reliquary</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi-process</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is built using a multi-process approach where each process
        is only doing one thing. This allows for more fine-grained sandboxing
        in relation to permissions or allowed system calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        Packets flow between these processes in a well-defined manner
        making it impossible to move a packet straight from the red
        side to the black side without passing the encryption process and
        vice-versa.
    </p>

    <h2>Encryption</h2>

    <p>
        See <a href="/crypto.html">our cryptography page</a> for
        a detailed description of the cryptosystem in sanctum.
    </p>

    <h2>Why would I want to use this?</h2>

    <p>
        Well, you don't have to. I built Sanctum for me and my hacker friends
        with the over a decade of experience I have building this type of stuff
        at very high assurance levels. There are
        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com" target="_blank">plenty</a>
        <a href="https://openvpn.net" target="_blank">of</a>
        <a href="https://strongswan.org" target="_blank">alternatives</a>
        out there.
    </p>

    <p>
        None of them have cool mythology nor provide you with the
        same type of post-quantum security or privilege separation as
        Sanctum does though.
    </p>

    <p>
        Another benefit is the ability to setup your own entire cathedral
        network allowing you to build a distributed infrastructure so your
        devices can always discover and talk to each other no matter what.
    </p>
