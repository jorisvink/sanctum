This is an embed of my open source project Nyfe.

This part is only enough to build libnyfe.
Note that libnyfe isn't really a library and shouldn't be used as such.

The libnyfe "library" contains some cryptographic primitives
which sanctum is using throughout the code.

See https://github.com/jorisvink/nyfe for more.

The code was taken at 1d4b85a307117752abd6bc89633bb72e7d4132b1.
