.SH DESIGN
.I Sanctum
is built using a multi-process approach where each process is only
doing one thing. This allows for more fine-grained sandboxing
in relation to permissions or allowed system calls.

Packets flow between these processes in a well-defined manner making
it impossible to move a packet straight from the red side to the black
side without passing the encryption process and vice-versa.

.SH ENCRYPTION
Traffic is by default encrypted under AES256-GCM with unique keys in
both the RX and TX directions using a 96-bit nonce consisting of a 32-bit
salt and 64-bit packet counter.

.I Sanctum
uses a strong symmetrical secret shared between two peers that wish to
communicate. Session keys are derived from the shared symmetrical secret
in combination with the shared secrets from a classical ECDH (x25519)
exchange and a PQ-secure ML-KEM-1024 exchange that happens in both RX
and TX directions.

Key exchanges are protected using a different key derived from the
shared symmetrical secret.

Keys are automatically expired after a given number of packets
have been sent on them (1 << 34), or after a 1-hour period.
