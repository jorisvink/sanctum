    <h2>What is sanctum?</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is a small, reviewable, experimental and <strong>fully
        privilege seperated</strong> VPN daemon capable of transporting
        encrypted network traffic between two peers.
    </p>

    <h2>Multi-process</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum is built using a multi-process approach where each process
        is only doing one thing. This allows for more fine-grained sandboxing
        in relation to permissions or allowed system calls.
    </p>

    <p>
        Several different processes exist that all only perform one task:
        <ul>
        <li>bless - The encryption process.</li>
        <li>confess - The decryption process.</li>
        <li>chapel - The key exchange process.</li>
        <li>heaven-rx - The red side receiving process.</li>
        <li>heaven-tx - The red side transmitting process.</li>
        <li>purgatory-rx - The black side receiving process.</li>
        <li>purgatory-tx - The black side transmitting process.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Packets flow between these processes in a well-defined manner
        making it impossible to move a packet straight from the red
        side to the black side without passing the encryption process and
        vice-versa.
    </li>

    <h2>Traffic encryption</h2>

    <p>
        Traffic is by default encrypted under AES256-GCM with unique keys in
        both RX and TX directions using a 96-bit nonce consisting of a 32-bit
        salt and a 64-bit packet counter (see rfc4106).
    </p>

    <p>
        Using the <strong>CIPHER</strong> environment variable you can however
        change traffic encryption to use <a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/sanctum/blob/master/nyfe/src/agelas.c" target="_blank">Agelas</a>,
        which is an experimental duplex-sponge AEAD cipher based on the
        Keccak-p[1600,24] permutation.
    </p>

    <h2>Key exchange</h2>

    <p>
        Sanctum uses strong shared symmetrical secrets from which an
        encryption key is derived for wrapping a generated session
        key that is transmitted to its peer. Each sanctum instance is
        responsible for sending its <strong>RX</strong> session key
        to its configured peer periodically.
    </p>

    <p>
        Keys are expired automatically after a given number of packets
        have been submitted on them (1 << 34), or after 1-hour.
    </p>

    <p>
        The underlying algorithm for wrapping the generated session key is
        the AEAD duplex-sponge stream cipher mentioned earlier. The entire
        key derivation and offer process is as follows:
    </p>

<pre>
    Wrapping key (wk) derivation:
        s = shared secret, 256-bit
        se = seed selected uniformly at random, 512-bit
        wk = KMAC256(s, len(se) || se), 512-bit

    Key offer:
        now = Seconds since boot, 64-bit
        salt = The salt for nonce construction, 32-bit
        id = unique sanctum ID generated at start, 64-bit
        key = session key selected uniformly at random, 256-bit

        seed = se from wk derivation above
        spi = The SPI for this association

        header = magic || spi || seed
        encdata = id || now || key || salt

        encdata = Agelas(wk, aad=header, encdata)
        send(header || encdata)
</pre>

    <p>
        While this alone does not provide PFS, the underlying key
        may be swapped out OOB by other means while sanctum is running.

        I recommend you rotate this key often via a mechanism of your liking.
    </p>

    <h2>Why did you write sanctum?</h2>

    <p>
        I wrote it so I can be certain that my packets are blessed
        correctly according to the scriptures of cryptology.
    </p>

    <h2>Huh?</h2>

    <p>
        Ok, I wrote sanctum because I wanted something I can trust
        fully myself. I am a very private person and want to
        excercise my right to privacy, even online.
        There are definitely alternatives, but I opted to
        carve out something for myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Plus, it's cool to hack on stuff.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes you qualified to build this?</h2>

    <p>
        If you are asking yourself that question, that's ok.
        The people who know, know. I have been building these
        type of things for many years at high assurance levels.
        Now, if this makes you nervous and rather not use Sanctum that is
        fine, there are
        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com" target="_blank">plenty</a>
        <a href="https://openvpn.net" target="_blank">of</a>
        <a href="https://strongswan.org" target="_blank">alternatives</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        But none of them have cool mythology though ;)
