This is an embed of my open source project Nyfe.

This part is only enough to build libnyfe.

The libnyfe library contains some cryptographic primitives
which sanctum is using throughout the code.

See https://github.com/jorisvink/nyfe for more.

The code was taken at 1d4b85a307117752abd6bc89633bb72e7d4132b1.
