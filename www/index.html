    <h3>What is sanctum?</h3>

    <p>
        Sanctum is a small, reviewable, experimental and <strong>fully
        privilege seperated</strong> VPN daemon capable of transporting
        encrypted network traffic between two peers.
    </p>

    <h3>Why did you write sanctum?</h3>

    <p>
        I wrote it so I can be certain that my packets are blessed
        correctly according to the scriptures of cryptology.
    </p>

    <h3>Huh?</h3>

    <p>
        Ok, I wrote sanctum because I wanted something I can trust
        fully myself. I am a very private person and want to
        excercise my right to privacy, even online.
        There are definitely alternatives, but I opted to
        carve out something for myself.
    </p>

    <p>
        Plus, it's cool to hack on stuff.
    </p>

    <h3>What makes you qualified to build this?</h3>

    <p>
        If you are asking yourself that question, that's ok.
        The people who know, know.
    </p>

    <p>
        If this makes you nervous and rather not use Sanctum that is
        fine, there are
        <a href="https://www.wireguard.com" target="_blank">plenty</a>
        <a href="https://openvpn.net" target="_blank">of</a>
        <a href="https://strongswan.org" target="_blank">alternatives</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        But none of them have cool mythology though ;)
    </p>

    <h3>Duplex-sponge based cryptography</h3>

    <p>
        Sanctum contains cryptography based on the duplex-sponge
        construct, it uses this for traffic protection when built
        with CIPHER=nyfe-<a href="https://github.com/jorisvink/sanctum/blob/master/nyfe/src/agelas.c" target="_blank">agelas</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Sanctum always uses the duplex-sponge based cipher for
        wrapping session keys when they are to be transmitted to your peer.
    </p>
