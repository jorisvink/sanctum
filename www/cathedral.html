<h2>How to setup a cathedral</h2>

<p>
    This guide will help you setup your own cathedral that can be used as a
    discovery and key distribution point for your own flocks and peers. This
    guide assumes that you are familiar with your system and networking.
</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>
    You should have compiled and installed sanctum according to the
    <a href="https://sanctorum.se/guide.html" target="_blank">
    tunnel setup guide</a>.
</p>

<h3>Cathedral setup</h3>

<p>
    You should create three system accounts that will be used by the
    cathedral to properly privilege separate the control, cathedral and
    purgatory processes.
</p>

<p>
    How you do that is left as an excercise for the reader as that depends
    on your OS. A suggestion on what to name the accounts could be as
    follows:

    <ul>
        <li>_purgatory-rx</li>
        <li>_purgatory-tx</li>
        <li>_cathedral</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h3>Key management</h3>

<p>
    The cathedral requires an ambry bundle for each flock that it should serve,
    refer to the reliquary its <a href="https://reliquary.se/guide.html#key-management">key management guide</a> on how to do this.
</p>

<h3>Cathedral configuration</h3>

<p>
    You use the sanctum binary in cathedral mode to run a cathedral.
</p>

<p>
    Here is a minimal example configuration:

<pre>
mode cathedral
instance cathedral-test

pidfile /tmp/cathedral-test.pid
local 1.2.3.4:4500
secret /home/cathedral/sync.secret
secretdir /home/cathedral/shared/identities
settings /home/cathedral/shared/settings.conf

run control as root
run cathedral as _cathedral
run purgatory-rx as _purgatory-rx
run purgatory-tx as _purgatory-tx
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Besides the paths that are explicitly mentioned in the configuration file,
    in the secretdir you have to create a directory for each flock that you
    will serve with the cathedral.

<pre>
$ mkdir -p /home/cathedral/shared/identities
$ mkdir /home/cathedral/shared/identities/flock-&lt;flock&gt;
</pre>

</p>

<p>
    The format for their name should be flock-&lt;flock id&gt;. In this
    directory, you have to put a secret key and cosk public key per peer
    in this flock. These are used for traffic protection and offer
    authentication between the client and cathedral, never for normal traffic.
</p>

<p>
    The secret key is a 256-bit symmetrical shared secret shared between the
    cathedral and client and is stored on the cathedral in the format of
    &lt;peer id&gt;.key. The cosk public key is an ed25519 public key
    generated using ambry tool on the client side. The cosk public key
    is stored in this directory as &lt;peer id&gt;.pub. The peer id
    is the id you will define later in settings.conf
</p>

<p>
    These keys have to be distributed to the peers that will use the cathedral
    in a secure way, but that is left as an excercise to the reader because
    that is out of scope for this guide.
</p>

<p>
    Local has to be an IP and port that is reachable by all the peers that will
    be using the cathedral.
</p>

<p>
    Secret is a key that should be 32 bytes of random data.
    An example of how to generate this key is by using the following command:
<pre>
$ dd if=/dev/urandom of=/home/cathedral/sync.secret bs=32 count=1
</pre>

    While the cosk can be generated as follows:
<pre>
$ ambry cosk-pair /tmp/cosk-private /tmp/cosk-public
</pre>
</p>

<h3>Flock configuration</h3>

<p>
    To create one or several flocks, they have to be defined in the file
    pointed to by the settings option in the cathedral configuration.
</p>

<p>
    In our example configuration, that path is <strong>/home/cathedral/shared/settings.conf</strong>. The format for the configuration of a flock is:

<pre>
flock &lt;flock id&gt; {
    allow &lt;peer id 1&gt; spi &lt;kek id 1&gt; &lt;bandwidth limit&gt;
    allow &lt;peer id 2&gt; spi &lt;kek id 2&gt; &lt;bandwidth limit&gt;

    ambry /path/to/ambry.bundle
}
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    The format for the flock name is a 64-bit hex value. The peer
    ids are 32-bit hex strings. The kek ids is the hex number of
    the kek associated with the peer, prefixed with 0x.
</p>

<p>
    The bandwidth limit is a unsigned integer that represents the limit in
    Mbit per second that the peer will be limited to. A value of 0 is the
    equivalent to unlimited bandwidth.
</p>

<p>
    An example flock, with two peers defined could look like this:

<pre>
flock cafebabe {
    allow deadbeef spi 0x1 0
    allow deadbabe spi 0x2 0

    ambry /home/cathedral/shared/ambries/ambry-cafebabe
}
</pre>

<p>
    Using an ambry bundle is not strictly required for a flock, if there
    already is a shared secret distributed to all the peers. The cathedral
    would then only be used to relay the traffic but this is left as an
    excercise to the reader.
</p>

<h3>Peer configuration</h3>

<p>
    The easiest way to configure a tunnel that uses the cathedral and flock
    that just was setup is to use the hymn tool.
</p>

<p>
    If we were configuring the peer deadbeef, with kek id 1 to use the
    cathedral with hymn:

<pre>
$ hymn add cafebabe-01-02 tunnel 172.31.253.1/24 mtu 1422 \
    kek /tmp/kek-0x01 cathedral 1.2.3.4:4500 \
    identity deadbeef:/tmp/cs-deadbeef cosk /tmp/cosk-private
</pre>

    Note that you need /tmp/kek-0x01, /tmp/cs-deadbeef and /tmp/cosk-private
    on that system.
</p>

<p>
    Likewise, configuring the peer deadbabe to connect to deadbeef with
    hymn looks similar:

<pre>
$ hymn add cafebabe-02-01 tunnel 172.31.253.2/24 mtu 1422 \
    kek /tmp/kek-0x02 cathedral 1.2.3.4:4500 \
    identity deadbabe:/tmp/cs-deadbabe cosk /tmp/cosk-private
</pre>

    Note that you need /tmp/kek-0x02, /tmp/cs-deadbabe and /tmp/cosk-private
    on that system.
</p>

<h3>NAT discovery and hole punching</h3>

<p>
    The cathedral mode has the possibility of detecting if its possible for
    peers to connect directly to eachother to get a peer-to-peer connection.
</p>

<p>
    To setup the cathedral to listen for traffic from the client to
    determine its NAT type, specify the following configuration:

<pre>
cathedral_p2p_sync yes
cathedral_nat_port 4501
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    The option cathedral_p2p_sync enables the cathedral to sync p2p states
    with other cathedrals. This allows p2p discovery even if each client
    is connected to a different cathedral in the setup.
</p>

<p>
    The option cathedral_nat_port configures on which port the cathedral will
    listen to additional peer traffic to determine its NAT type.
</p>

<p>
    If the cathedral learns that both peers are behind a NAT type that
    allows hole punching it will inform both sides with the relevant
    information to do this.
</p>

<h3>Federation</h3>

<p>
    The cathedral mode also has the possibilty of federating with other
    cathedrals which allows you to truly build distributed infrastructure.
</p>

<p>
    For that to work all cathedrals that want to federate with each other
    need the same federation secret. How this federation secret is distributed
    between the cathedrals is left as an excercise to the reader.
</p>

<p>
    To enable federation for a cathedral, use the following configuration
    in the cathedral configuration:

<pre>
secret /path/to/federation.secret
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    Then add the federated cathedrals in the <i>settings.conf</i> file:
<pre>
federate &ltip address&gt; &lt;port&gt;
</pre>
</p>

<p>
    You can federate to up to 32 other cathedrals.
