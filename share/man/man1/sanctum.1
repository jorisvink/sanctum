.SH DESIGN
.I Sanctum
is built using a multi-process approach where each process is only
doing one thing. This allows for more fine-grained sandboxing
in relation to permissions or allowed system calls.

Packets flow between these processes in a well-defined manner making
it impossible to move a packet straight from the red side to the black
side without passing the encryption process and vice-versa.

.SH ENCRYPTION
Traffic is by default encrypted under AES256-GCM with unique keys in
both the RX and TX directions using a 96-bit nonce consisting of a 32-bit
salt and 64-bit packet counter (see rfc4106).

.I Sanctum
uses a strong shared symmetrical secret shared between two peers that wish to
communicate. This key is primarily used for key offers and key encryption.
Session keys are derived partially from the shared secret and partially from a
post-quantum safe, forward-secrecy protecting ECDH (x25519) and ML-KEM-1024
handshake.

Keys are automatically expired after a given number of packets
have been sent on them (1 << 34), or after a 1-hour period.
